Metrolinx Founded
---

+ Started 2006 as Greater Toronto Transportation Authority
+ Crowned Corporation, introduced with "38:2 Bill 104, Greater Toronto Transportation Authority Act, 2006"
+ Repealed "GO Transit Act, 2001" within the act
+ 2 Divisions
	1. Farecard Division (Presto)
	2. Transportation Procurement Division (purchasing lines, trains, buses etc)
+ Objectives of Corporation
	1. To provide leadership in building multi-modal (e.g. bus+bike, train+subway) transportation network under the "Places to Grow Act, 2005"
	2. To act as the central procurement agency for all transit in the area (ie they buy the buses that HSR needs)
+ Basically build plans and find many for large scale transit projects
+ Also have a unified fare system so that bus to train to bus is seamless (and cheaper)
+ Board of directors made up of people appointed by Lieutenant Governor recommended by the various councils
+ Goal boiled down to removing politics from building and running modern transportation networks, been criticized that it hasn't done enough of this


History
---

+ Hamilton had 55 different railway companies at one point (1800's) (exact number needs to be verified, customs house tour guide provided this fact)
+ Was steel city because of this
+ Most railway companies simply rented out other's lines
+ Canadian Pacific Railway, Canadian National Railway owned majority of lines (as of 1998 still did), TH&B (Toronto-Hamilton and Buffalo) owned a few alternate lines
+ 


Metrolinx, monopoly advantage
---
+ Used to rent tracks from other companies
+ Purchased unused tracks (CPR and CN only use certain lines for commercial trains, a lot of other lines are mostly unused)
+ Went from owning 8% (1998) of it's tracks to 68%
+ Owning their own tracks saves them money in the long run, and gives them more control
+ Built many new stations, expanded network and service, still building more (new john st station)

Other Crown-Corporations
---
###Canadian National Railway 
+ from inception to 1995
+ Now publically traded (fun fact, bill gates is largest single shareholder)
+ Many railway companies went bankrupt, and fell into government hands
+ Formed from the remains of those companies, and a few of it's own
###Via Rail
+ Made from CN's passenger service


Why is it not private
---
+ Public transit is traditionally in the hands of the government
+ Huge upfront costs (billions of dollars)
+ People don't pay much for transit, so costs can't reasonably be recovered
+ Requires huge co-operation with city planning, government services (can't just build a new transit terminal downtown without working very closely with the city)
+ Mostly true for bus lines, and subways, intra-city transportation
+ Trains can be privatized and allowed non-monopoly easier as fares are higher, and lines can also be shared with commercial use
+ Same thing with inter-city buses (greyhound etc)
+ Intra-city is a monopoly, inter-city is not
+ Inter-city has more possible routes, and more passengers, so multiple companies can co-exist

Private?
---
+ Andrea Horwath said liberals are trying to privatize the TTC, Kathleen Wynne denies
+ No-where in plan does it mention privatization
+ Horwath most likely misunderstood hiring private companies to build stations as privatizing transit
+ Doubtful any private company would want intra-city bus lines, they aren't very profitable
