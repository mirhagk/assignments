<p><abbr title="carbon copy">c.c.</abbr>The Honourable Paul Martin, P.C., M.P.<br>
Minister of Finance</p>

<p>Dear Chairmen:</p>

<p>The mandate of the Competition Bureau is to ensure that Canada has a <span class="NoWrap">competitive marketplace</span> and that all Canadians enjoy the benefits of competition. This requires that proposed mergers be reviewed to determine if they are likely to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition.</p>

<p>After a comprehensive review, <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> has concluded that the merger of the <a href="http://www.cibc.com/index.html" class="ui-link"><span class="NoWrap">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</span> (<abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr>)</a> and the <a href="http://www.tdbank.ca/" class="ui-link"><span class="NoWrap">Toronto-Dominion Bank (<abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr>)</span></a> <span class="NoWrap">(the Banks)</span>, as proposed, is likely to lead to a substantial lessening or prevention of competition that would cause higher prices and lower levels of service and choice for several key banking services in Canada.</p>

<p>Traditionally, when the Bureau concludes that a proposed merger is likely to harm competition, it invites the merging parties to propose remedies to remove the likely lessening of competition. Any remedies must ensure that the concerns are removed in all affected markets. Typically, this has involved selling assets and restructuring the proposal.</p>

<p>However, in this case, as stated in the <em><span class="NoWrap">Merger Enforcement Guidelines as Applied to a Bank Merger</span></em> <span class="NoWrap">(the Guidelines)</span>, this letter outlines in general terms the sort of measures that have historically been applied to deal with competitive concerns. It is up to the parties to determine if it is appropriate to explore potential remedies with <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> after receiving this letter and after taking into account any public interest concerns expressed by the <span class="NoWrap">Minister of Finance</span>.</p>

<p>The Bureau has assessed the proposed merger in the traditional manner by gathering information and analysing any possible <span class="NoWrap">anti-competitive</span> effects, such as undue concentration, which would indicate a lessening of competition should the merger proceed. The details of the process followed were announced <span class="NoWrap">in July 1998</span> and are contained in <span class="NoWrap">the Guidelines</span>.</p>

<p>The Bureau has no regulatory authority to allow or disapprove mergers. Its role is to review the proposed merger for its impact on competition and make the results of its review known to the Banks. In this case, the Bureau will also send a copy of this letter to the <span class="NoWrap">Minister of Finance</span> who has the ultimate authority to approve the merger under the <em><span class="NoWrap">Bank Act</span></em>.</p>

<p>The Bureau uses a <span class="NoWrap">two-year time frame</span> within which to assess the likely competitive impact of a merger. For the purposes of its analysis, the Bureau examined the impact on competition of all banking services and determined that a detailed analysis was required for three major lines of business in which the banks are engaged: branch banking services to individuals and businesses, credit cards, and securities.</p>

<p>Other areas of banking did not pose competition concerns and therefore were not subject to detailed review. While the Bureau anticipates a number of significant changes to the banking industry over the next decade due to innovation and technology, these are unlikely to mitigate the <span class="NoWrap">anti-competitive</span> impact of the proposed merger in the next two years.</p>

<p>As outlined in the Guidelines, <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> conducted the analysis of both the proposed merger of <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> and <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and that of the <span class="NoWrap">Royal Bank of Canada</span> and <span class="NoWrap">Bank of Montreal</span> at the same time. To ignore either proposed transaction in the analysis of the other would fail to capture the full impact of both occurring at the same time. In this regard, it is important to assess how the removal of two major banks would affect concentration levels and the competitive vigour of the industry.</p>

<section>
 <h2>Summary of Conclusions</h2> 

<p>As a result of the review conducted by the Bureau and on the basis of the materials submitted, advice of experts, and information provided by third parties, the merger as presently structured will have the following results.</p>

 <h3>A. Branch Banking</h3> 

<p>For individuals, branch banking services consist of personal transaction accounts, <span class="NoWrap">personal loans/lines</span> of credit and residential mortgages.</p>

<p>For businesses, in particular small and <span class="NoWrap">medium-sized businesses</span> (<abbr title="small and medium-sized businesses">SMEs</abbr>), these services consist of business transaction accounts and related services, and operating loans.</p>

<p>(i) The proposed merger:</p>

<ul class="space">
<li>will result in a substantial lessening of competition <span class="NoWrap">in 36 of the 179 local markets</span> in which these banks compete;</li>
<li>may result in a substantial lessening of competition in another <span class="NoWrap">53 local markets</span>; these markets are problematic and require further detailed review before we can confirm if a substantial lessening of competition will result;</li>
<li>will not result in a substantial lessening of competition in the remaining <span class="NoWrap">90 local markets</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(ii) The proposed merger:</p>

<ul class="space">
<li>will result in a substantial lessening of competition in <span class="NoWrap">Prince Edward Island</span>, Yukon and the <span class="NoWrap">Northwest Territories</span> for <span class="NoWrap">mid-market</span> businesses with operating loans between <span class="NoWrap">$1 million</span> and <span class="NoWrap">$5 million</span>.</li>
</ul>

 <h3>B. Credit Cards</h3> 

<p>(i) The proposed merger:</p>

<ul class="space">
<li>will not result in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for general purpose credit card network services.</li>
</ul>

<p>(ii) The proposed merger:</p>

<ul class="space">
<li>will not result in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for the issuing of general purpose credit cards to individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p>(iii) The proposed merger:</p>

<ul class="space">
<li>will result in a substantial lessening of competition in the <span class="NoWrap"><em>Visa</em> merchant</span> acquiring market (the business of providing settlement of <span class="NoWrap">Visa credit card</span> transactions to merchants).</li>
</ul>

<p>(iv) The proposed merger:</p>

<ul class="space">
<li>may result, at the national level, in a substantial lessening of competition for primary merchant acquiring (the business of providing both terminals and settlement of credit card transactions to merchants) for <abbr title="small and medium-sized businesses"><span class="NoWrap">SME merchants</span></abbr>. <em>Primary</em> merchant acquiring is problematic and requires further detailed review at the local or regional level before we can confirm if a substantial lessening of competition will result.</li>
<li>will result, at the national level, in a substantial lessening of competition for <em>primary</em> merchant acquiring for <abbr title="small and medium-sized businesses"><span class="NoWrap">SME merchants</span></abbr> should both mergers proceed.</li>
</ul>

 <h3>C. Securities</h3> 

<p>(i) The proposed merger:</p>

<ul class="space">
<li>will result in a substantial lessening of competition in one market of the <span class="NoWrap">22 local markets</span> in which <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce"><span class="NoWrap">CIBC Wood Gundy</span></abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank Greenline Investor Services"><span class="NoWrap">TD Evergreen </span></abbr>compete in <span class="NoWrap">full-service brokerage</span>;</li>
<li>may result in a substantial lessening of competition in <span class="NoWrap">two markets</span>; these markets are problematic and require further detailed review before we can confirm if a substantial lessening of competition will result;</li>
<li>will not result in a substantial lessening of competition in <span class="NoWrap">19 markets</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These conclusions are based in part on the market share levels as measured by assets under administration in local markets. The Bureau would be prepared to review these conclusions, if information having a material impact becomes available at the local level which would indicate that the market shares, as calculated, significantly overstate the market position of the <span class="NoWrap">Bank-owned firms</span>.</p>

<p>(ii) The proposed merger:</p>

<ul class="space">
<li>will not result in a substantial lessening of competition in the national market for discount brokerage services.This conclusion takes into account the moderate barriers to entry combined with the number of new competitors, which together have steadily eroded the dominant position of Greenline.</li>
</ul>

 <h2>The Proposed Merger</h2> 

<p>The <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> notified the Bureau of their proposal on <span class="NoWrap">April 17, 1998</span>. This immediately triggered a review under the merger provisions of the <em><span class="NoWrap">Competition Act</span></em>. The Banks seek to amalgamate under the <em><span class="NoWrap">Bank Act </span></em>to combine all their operations which provide a broad range of services to both individuals and businesses through their national branch networks, <span class="NoWrap">credit card</span> operations and securities firms.</p>

<p>The proposed merger would combine the banks ranked second and fifth in Canada based on the value of Canadian assets. As of <span class="NoWrap">December 31, 1997</span>, the merging banks held approximately <span class="NoWrap">$275 billion</span> in assets in Canada.</p>

<p>The Banks have taken the position that it is necessary to become larger and more efficient to compete effectively, both in Canada and internationally. The Banks contend that larger foreign institutions have a cost advantage, including those using electronic technology to deliver financial services, and are becoming an increasing threat. The Banks also assert that the merger would result in significant cost savings.</p>

<section>
 <h2>Scope of the Bureau's Review</h2> 

<p>The Bureau's mandate under the <cite>Competition Act</cite> is confined to assessing whether or not a proposed merger is likely to lessen or prevent competition substantially. This will be the case when a merger is likely to result in higher prices, less choice or reduced service. Any merger that is likely to have such an impact may be prohibited under <span class="NoWrap">the Act</span>, unless there are efficiencies created by the merger that outweigh the negative impact on competition.</p>

<p>Throughout its review, the Bureau obtained information from the <span class="NoWrap">four banks</span>, including approximately <span class="NoWrap">400,000 pages</span> of documents. The Bureau met with representatives of the <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> at every stage of the process to ensure that it fully understood the Banks' position, to obtain information, and to explain and discuss the results of its review.</p>

<p>The Bureau obtained valuable information from individuals, groups representing consumers and business, other providers of financial services, and government agencies. Furthermore, the Bureau sought the advice of more business and economic experts than in any other merger it has reviewed.</p>

<p>The review process took approximately <span class="NoWrap">eight months</span> because of the voluminous nature of the documentation, the complexity of the banking business, the timing of the report of the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force</span> on the Future of the Canadian Financial Services Sector <span class="NoWrap">(the Task Force)</span>, and the need to obtain information under court order from <span class="NoWrap">third parties</span> and the banks.</p>

<p>Attached as <a href="http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01650.html" class="ui-link">Appendix A</a> is a glossary of terms and definitions that the Bureau has compiled in conducting its review.</p>
</section>

<section>
 <h2>Analytical Approach</h2> 

<p>The analysis conducted by the Bureau covered an extensive range of products and geographic areas in which the banks compete throughout the country. The framework for analysis in the Guidelines was written after extensive public consultation and reflected a broad consensus that the Bureau was using the right approach.</p>

<p>As explained in the Guidelines, there are four major steps in determining whether or not a particular bank transaction would substantially lessen or prevent competition.</p>

<ul class="space">

<li>Relevant markets are defined to identify which products, where and with whom the banks compete. A relevant market consists of a group of products that are close substitutes. Each group represents a separate product market with its own geographic market dimensions.</li>

<li>Market shares and concentration levels are calculated for each relevant market. A more detailed review is generally required if <span class="NoWrap">a) the share</span> held by the banks is <span class="NoWrap">35% or greater</span>, or <span class="NoWrap">b) the combined</span> share held by the four largest competitors is <span class="NoWrap">65% or greater</span> (and the share held by the merging banks <span class="NoWrap">exceeds 10%</span>).</li> 

<li>A variety of competitive criteria are evaluated for each relevant market under detailed review. The goal is to determine whether or not the merger is likely to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition. These typically include the extent of foreign competition faced by the banks, the barriers that would be encountered should other companies wish to enter a particular market, the impact of technology, whether or not the merger will remove a vigorous and effective competitor, the effectiveness of the remaining competition, and any other factor relevant to competition.</li>

<li>Claimed efficiencies are considered if it is concluded that the merger results in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition. <span class="NoWrap">The Act</span> provides that a merger may proceed provided <span class="NoWrap">a) it is</span> likely to result in efficiencies that would not otherwise be realized, and <span class="NoWrap">b) such efficiencies</span> would outweigh the <span class="NoWrap">anti-competitive impact</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the Bureau's analytical approach, it is presumed a merger will not harm competition when markets are unconcentrated, entry is easy and effective competition remains. Therefore, the analysis may end if at any stage the evidence demonstrates that the relevant market will not result in competition concerns.</p>

<h2>Competition Analysis</h2>  
<h3>A. Branch Banking</h3> 
  
<p>This section examines the markets for branch banking services provided to consumers and businesses in Canada.</p>

 
<h4>Product Markets</h4>  
<h5>Personal Financial Services</h5> 
  
<p>Within this category of services provided to individuals through branches, the Bureau defined the following product markets:</p>

<ul class="space">
<li>Personal <span class="NoWrap">long-term</span> investments</li>
<li>Personal <span class="NoWrap">short-term</span> savings</li>
<li>Student loans</li>
<li>Personal transaction accounts</li>
<li>Residential mortgages</li>
<li>Personal <span class="NoWrap">loans/lines</span> of credit</li>
</ul>

 <h6>Personal <span class="NoWrap">Long-term</span> Investments</h6> 
  
<p>Personal <span class="NoWrap">long-term</span> investments include most mutual funds, bonds and stocks. Personal <span class="NoWrap">short-term</span> savings include guaranteed investment certificates, money market mutual funds, Canada and provincial savings bonds, and treasury bills.</p>
  

<p>The Bureau concluded that no detailed review was required with respect to student loans, <span class="NoWrap">personal long-term investments</span> and <span class="NoWrap">short-term savings</span>. Either the remaining competition was effective or the applicable thresholds were not crossed for these products. A detailed review was required for the remaining product markets.</p>

 <h6>Personal Transaction Accounts</h6> 
  
<p>Transaction accounts are the core of the personal banking relationship. They enable an account holder to make deposits and withdrawals through savings or chequing accounts and to receive reports on those activities. These transactions may take place either at the local branch or through some other means such as <span class="NoWrap">an automated banking machine</span> (<abbr title="automated banking machine">ABM</abbr>), <span class="NoWrap">debit card</span>, telephone, <span class="NoWrap">personal computer</span> or the Internet.</p>

 <h6>Residential Mortgages</h6> 
  
<p>A residential mortgage is the principal form of <span class="NoWrap">long-term</span> personal debt for many Canadians. Most mortgages are used to buy a home. For those with significant equity, it is possible to use a line of credit to fund a home purchase. However, this option is not open to <span class="NoWrap">home-owners</span> with lower levels of equity. Consequently, we have decided that residential mortgages are sufficiently distinct from lines of credit that they constitute a relevant product market.</p>

 <h6>Personal Loans/Lines of Credit</h6> 
  
<p>Personal loans and lines of credit are another distinct type of consumer credit for the purposes of our analysis. Credit cards, with the exception of <span class="NoWrap">low-rate credit cards</span>, carry interest rates that are more than twice the interest rates of personal loans and lines of credit and therefore are not considered good substitutes. Similarly, loans from consumer finance companies are priced so much higher than loans from <span class="NoWrap">deposit-taking institutions</span> that they have been excluded from this market.</p>

 <h5>Business Financial Services</h5> 
  
<p>Within the category of services provided to businesses at the branch level, the Bureau defined the following product markets:</p>
  
<ul class="space">
<li>Term loans </li>
<li>Business transaction accounts and related services </li>
<li>Operating loans</li>
</ul>

 <h6>Term loans</h6> 
  
<p>Term loans, including <span class="NoWrap">non-residential mortgages</span>, are generally <span class="NoWrap">mid- to longer-term </span>in nature and typically secured by collateral to purchase equipment, buildings and real estate. We have included leased equipment in this category. The Bureau concluded that no detailed review was required for term loans, because the remaining competition was effective and provided businesses with adequate competitive alternatives or the applicable thresholds were not crossed. A detailed review was required for the remaining product markets.</p>

 <h6>Business Transaction Accounts and Related Services</h6> 
  
<p>Transaction accounts are the core of the business banking relationship. They allow firms to pay bills and collect receivables. Other products, such as night deposit and cash and coin services, are generally linked to this account.</p>

 <h6>Operating Loans</h6> 
  
<p>Operating loans are intended for the <span class="NoWrap">short-term</span> operating needs of businesses such as financing receivables and inventory. Banks will generally not give an operating loan unless a business has its transaction account at the same bank. This gives the lending banks the ability to monitor a customer's business on a continuing basis. To gauge the potential impact of the proposed merger in this market, it is necessary to examine the competitive choices available to firms of different sizes.</p>
  
<p>Since large corporations typically have access to more domestic and foreign suppliers and ready access to capital markets, operating loans to these businesses were not considered problematic. Small and <span class="NoWrap">medium-sized</span>(<a href="http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01601.html#footnote1" id="footnote1b" class="ui-link"><sup>1</sup></a>) businesses generally have fewer choices and rely on banking services at the local level. Operating loans with authorizations up to <span class="NoWrap">$1 million</span> were examined for <abbr title="small and medium-sized businesses">SMEs</abbr>. Larger firms in the <span class="NoWrap">mid-market tier</span> also face more limited choices than those in the large corporate sector. Loan authorizations in the <span class="NoWrap">$1-million</span> to <span class="NoWrap">$5-million range</span> were examined for these <span class="NoWrap">mid-market firms</span>.</p>

 <h4>Geographic Markets</h4> 
  
<p>After extensive examination of the records produced by the Banks, interviews with industry participants, econometric analysis prepared by the Bureau, and on the advice of the experts retained by the Bureau, we have concluded that the geographic market is local for the relevant products listed above, for customers of personal financial services and for <abbr title="small and medium-sized"><span class="NoWrap">SME businesses</span></abbr>.</p>
  
<p>For <span class="NoWrap">mid-market</span> loans between <span class="NoWrap">$1 million</span> and <span class="NoWrap">$5 million</span>, the geographic market is regional in scope. The Bureau has used provincial boundaries to approximate these regional geographic markets.</p>
  
<p>The Bureau identified <span class="NoWrap">112 local markets</span> in urban areas with <span class="NoWrap">populations of 10,000 to 100,000</span>, using the integrated economic areas identified by <span class="NoWrap">Statistics Canada</span> as <span class="NoWrap">census agglomerations (<abbr title="census agglomerations">CA</abbr>)</span>, and <span class="NoWrap">25 urban areas</span> of more than <span class="NoWrap">100,000 people</span>, identified by <span class="NoWrap">Statistics Canada</span> as census metropolitan areas (<abbr title="census metropolitan areas">CMA</abbr>). In total, there are <span class="NoWrap">137 local urban</span> markets. The operations of the Banks overlap <span class="NoWrap">in 111 of these urban markets</span>.</p>
  
<p>In rural areas, the Bureau examined the competitive environment of all branches of the <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> within <span class="NoWrap">20 km</span> of each other. This decision was based largely on the banks' documents. As a result, <span class="NoWrap">68 local rural markets</span> were identified for the proposed merger.</p>
  
<p>In total, the operations of the <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> overlap in <span class="NoWrap">179 local markets</span>.</p>

 <h4>Market Share and Concentration Levels</h4> 
  
<p>Given that the four firm concentration threshold was exceeded for at least one of the products under detailed review in each market, the Bureau's review included all <span class="NoWrap">179 local markets</span>.</p>
  
<p>For operating loans to <span class="NoWrap">mid-market firms</span> in the <span class="NoWrap">$1-million </span>to <span class="NoWrap">$5-million</span> range, the <span class="NoWrap">35% threshold</span> was exceeded in <span class="NoWrap">Prince Edward Island</span>, Yukon and the <span class="NoWrap">Northwest Territories</span>.</p>
  
<p>In order to calculate these market shares and concentration levels for <span class="NoWrap">branch banking products</span>, <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> obtained the market share data base maintained by the <span class="NoWrap">Canadian Bankers Association (<abbr title="Canadian Bankers Association">CBA</abbr>)</span>, and supplemented it with information from many other financial institutions and the <span class="NoWrap">Canadian Payments Association</span>. As a result, the data base includes nearly all <span class="NoWrap">deposit-taking institutions</span>. For those products where <span class="NoWrap">non-deposit</span> taking institutions are significant competitors, such as insurance companies for residential mortgages, further adjustments to the data base have been made.</p>
  
<p>This data base is the best available in Canada at this time. <span class="NoWrap">The Banks</span> have raised a number of issues relating to the <span class="NoWrap"><abbr title="Canadian Bankers Association">CBA</abbr> data base</span>. For example, the <abbr title="Canadian Bankers Association"><span class="NoWrap">CBA data base</span></abbr> does not categorize business transaction account data by size of business. This may result in some market shares being either <span class="NoWrap">over- or </span>understated for <abbr title="small and medium-sized business"><span class="NoWrap">SME firms</span></abbr>. <span class="NoWrap">The Bureau</span> is willing to further discuss these issues with the Banks.</p>

 <h4>Competitive Criteria</h4>
  
<h5>Barriers to Entry</h5> 
  
<p>In order to assess the effect of the merger on competition, the Bureau must consider the height of entry barriers into banking markets. Even where a merger exceeds the Bureau's initial thresholds, if barriers to entry are low, the merged firms will be constrained by the likelihood of new entrants, and will behave in a manner consistent with a competitive market. In conducting this analysis, the Bureau considers whether or not entry or expansion on a scale sufficient to offset a substantial lessening of competition is likely to occur within a <span class="NoWrap">two-year period</span> following the merger.</p>
  
<p>The Bureau has concluded that the entry barriers for new entrants into branch banking are high.</p>
  
<p>The extensive branch networks of the five major banks represent a significant sunk investment that is difficult for new entrants to replicate. Moreover, it takes an extended period of time before a branch can be expected to break even, with estimates ranging from <span class="NoWrap">three to seven years</span>. It should also be noted that the major banks have an advantage over new entrants in that they have already secured the best locations in most markets.</p>
  
<p>No one interviewed by the Bureau expects significant new entry into branch banking. Consequently, we have concluded new branch bank entry, other than by acquisition, is highly unlikely.</p>
  
<p>In addition to the costs of establishing a branch network, new entrants face a number of other barriers. There is some evidence that economies of scale and scope make entry more difficult for smaller firms. The evidence also indicates that customers are reluctant to switch their primary financial institution where their transaction account resides. Contributing factors would be the widespread use of direct payroll deposit and automatic bill payments.</p>
  
<p>In addition, the major banks have strong <span class="NoWrap">brand names</span> that have been developed over decades of advertising, and reinforced by local branch presence throughout Canada. An indication of the strength of customer loyalty is demonstrated by a report prepared for the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force</span> that says no institution has gained more than <span class="NoWrap">1% market share</span> in any year except by acquisition.</p>
  
<p>We recognize that the supply of residential mortgage loans is becoming less <span class="NoWrap">branch-dependent</span> due to the development of alternative origination channels. We note that the growth of new entrants for this product is constrained by consumers' limited acceptance to date of the use of independent mortgage brokers, the Internet, telephone and mail. This is particularly the case in rural and remote communities.</p>
  
<p>Small and <span class="NoWrap">medium-sized</span> business customers appear to be even more <span class="NoWrap">branch-dependent</span> than personal banking customers, due to the need for services such as <span class="NoWrap">night deposit</span>, and <span class="NoWrap">cash and coin services</span>. As with &gt;individual consumers, <abbr title="small and medium-sized business"><span class="NoWrap">SME customers</span></abbr> do not change their primary banking relationship very often, which makes it more difficult for new entrants to attract customers.</p>
  
<p>There are also a number of regulatory barriers that discourage entry:</p>
  
<ul class="space">
<li>Capital taxes must be paid regardless of profitability, raising the sunk costs of entry through <span class="NoWrap">start-up losses</span>.</li>
<li>Capital requirements and reporting costs are proportionately a greater burden for smaller firms.</li>
<li>Provincial regulation or business power restrictions in the federal <em><span class="NoWrap">Cooperative Credit Associations Act</span></em> may place limits on the ability of <span class="NoWrap">credit unions</span> to compete in certain areas, such as <span class="NoWrap">commercial lending</span>.</li>
<li>After 10 years, new Canadian banks (other than those owned by financial institutions 
which are themselves <span class="NoWrap">widely-held</span>) become subject to the <span class="NoWrap">widely-held rule</span>. This means that no shareholder can own more than <span class="NoWrap">10% of any class</span> of shares.</li>
<li>This 10% rule, combined with the rules requiring the head office to be located in Canada and the majority of the board of directors to be Canadian residents, effectively eliminates the possibility of foreign entry through the acquisition of an existing <span class="NoWrap">Schedule I bank</span>.</li>
<li>Once a Schedule II bank or trust company has equity of <span class="NoWrap">$750 million or greater</span>, there must be a public float of at least <span class="NoWrap">35% of its voting shares</span>, subject to exemption by the <span class="NoWrap">Minister of Finance</span>.</li>
<li>Access to the payments system is limited to federally and provincially regulated <span class="NoWrap">deposit-taking institutions</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>While existing competitors do not face the same levels of barriers new entrants face, expansion is impeded by the high costs of gaining new customers due to switching costs and the expectation that branch profitability may not be realized for up to <span class="NoWrap">seven years</span>.</p>

 <h5>Changes in Technology and Innovation</h5> 
  
<p>The Bureau has examined the impact that technology and innovation may have on lowering the barriers to entry and expanding the scope of the geographic market. While Canadians are making increased use of technology to do their banking, all evidence indicates that branches remain crucial to the success of a bank. Experts say this is unlikely to change <span class="NoWrap">within two years</span> following the merger, which is our period of analysis.</p>
  
<p>The Banks have indicated that the role of the traditional branch has been transformed as customers have migrated to the newer channels of distribution such as <span class="NoWrap">automated banking machines</span>, <span class="NoWrap">debit cards</span>, telephone, <span class="NoWrap">personal computer</span> and <span class="NoWrap">Internet banking</span>.</p>
  
<p>These methods of distribution, however, have not eliminated the need for bank branches. Personal contact, including advice and problem solving, remains key for sales of many financial products. All of the major banks are in the process of reconfiguring their branches to improve their sales capability, and have underlined the continuing importance of branch banking to build and maintain the relationships between bankers and their personal and business customers.</p>
  
<p>According to the <span class="NoWrap">McKinsey &amp; Company report</span> prepared for the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force</span>, transaction volume through branches from <span class="NoWrap">1994 to 1996</span> grew at a <span class="NoWrap">3% annual rate</span>. While recent data for some major banks indicates a decline in transaction volume as these newer channels of distribution have become more popular, our conclusion remains that branches will continue to be an important point of access to financial services for many bank customers for the foreseeable future.</p>
  
<p>The Banks have argued that Internet banking will significantly reduce barriers to entry and widen the scope of the geographic market by eliminating the need for a costly physical presence. Internet or <span class="NoWrap">virtual banking</span> is in a very early stage of development. According to a recent <span class="NoWrap">Ernst and Young report</span>, Internet banking is generally viewed by users at this time as a poor substitute for many of the services provided by a branch. As well, security considerations remain a barrier to widespread consumer acceptance and adoption.</p>
  
<p>In the view of a technology expert made available by one of the merging Banks, Internet technology will not replace the need for physical presence in the next <span class="NoWrap">five to ten years</span>. Another expert interviewed by the Bureau puts the time frame at <span class="NoWrap">between 10 and 15 years</span>. These time frames are well beyond the <span class="NoWrap">two-year period</span> considered by the Bureau in assessing the potential for new effective competitors to emerge.</p>
  
<p>In some respects, technology may have raised rather than lowered barriers to entry. According to records produced by the banks, customers have come to expect access to the new channels of distribution as a complement to using their branches.</p>
  
<p>The major banks, for example, have established <span class="NoWrap">proprietary nationwide <abbr title="Automated Banking Machines">ABM</abbr> networks</span>. While the Interac system allows cash withdrawal on a shared basis, other functions, such as deposits, <span class="NoWrap">passbook update</span>, the transfer of funds between financial institutions, and <span class="NoWrap">bill payment</span>, are not currently offered on a shared basis over the Interac network. New entrants would have to offer a network of <abbr title="Automated Banking Machines">ABM</abbr>s to match the major banks. Should the Interac system allow for full functionality, including <span class="NoWrap">deposit-taking</span> and funds transfer, the need for an extensive <span class="NoWrap">proprietary <abbr title="Automated Banking Machines">ABM</abbr> network</span> for new entrants would be reduced.</p>


 <h5>Foreign Competition</h5> 
  
<p>The Bureau defines foreign competition as those foreign institutions that are able to offer Canadian consumersfinancial services from outside Canada. Due to regulatory constraints, such competition is minimal for individual banking products. <span class="NoWrap">Foreign-controlled</span> <span class="NoWrap">deposit-taking institutions</span> that operate in Canada are discussed in the section on effective competition remaining.</p>

 <h5>Removal of an Effective Competitor</h5> 
  
<p>The proposed merger will reduce <span class="NoWrap">from five to four</span> the number of major national banks competing in Canada. As the <span class="NoWrap">second- and fifth-largest</span> banks in Canada, <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> are obviously effective competitors and customers have benefited from the competition between them. The loss of a major competitor is further cause for concern in light of the already high levels of concentration that exist in most local markets.</p>

 <h5>Effective Competition Remaining</h5> 
  
<p>Assessing the effectiveness of the remaining competition is an important consideration in determining whether or not the merged bank would be constrained in raising prices or reducing the quality or level of service. While we focus here on other <span class="NoWrap">deposit-taking institutions</span>, we also took into consideration the competition provided by <span class="NoWrap">non-deposit taking institutions</span>. This was most evident in residential mortgages where adjustments were made to market shares to account for the competition provided by other institutions.</p>
  
<p>The National Bank of Canada and <span class="NoWrap">Le Mouvement des Caisses Desjardins</span> <span class="NoWrap">(Caisses Desjardins)</span> represent significant competition in Quebec, and there are fewer competition concerns arising from the proposed merger in that province.</p>
  
<p>Canada Trust is an important regional player in Ontario, Alberta and <span class="NoWrap">British Columbia</span>. Of the <span class="NoWrap">Schedule II Banks</span>, only the <span class="NoWrap">Hongkong Bank</span> of Canada has meaningful retail banking presence, with about <span class="NoWrap">117 branches</span> located in <span class="NoWrap">major centres</span> and throughout <span class="NoWrap">British Columbia</span>.</p>
  
<p>The credit unions appear to be effective competitors to the banks in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the <span class="NoWrap">lower mainland</span> of <span class="NoWrap">British Columbia</span>, but are small players in other parts of the country and in business operating loans above <span class="NoWrap">$1 million</span>. <span class="NoWrap">Alberta Treasury Branches</span> provide competition in many local markets in Alberta.</p>
  
<p>The Bureau has considered the degree to which these competitors could replace the competition lost as a result of the proposed merger.</p>
  
<p>The Bank of Nova Scotia clearly has the capacity to expand and does not face the same entry barriers as would a new national entrant. However, the Banks have argued that one of the prime motivations for the merger is to capture additional substantial economies of scale which they believe exist. If this were true, <span class="NoWrap">the Bank of Nova Scotia</span>, at less than <span class="NoWrap">one-half</span> the size of the merged bank in the domestic market, would be at a significant cost disadvantage and would not be able to compete effectively unless it also merged with another major bank. By the same token, much smaller institutions, such as <span class="NoWrap">Canada Trust</span>, <span class="NoWrap">National Bank</span> and the <span class="NoWrap">credit unions</span>, would be even less able to compete effectively due to much higher cost positions.</p>
  
<p>As noted above, in the past it has been very difficult to entice consumers to switch their primary banking relationship, except by acquisition. The potential for the merged bank to <span class="NoWrap">cross-sell</span> and <span class="NoWrap">data mine</span> its larger customer base may further impede switching. While a competitive opportunity may arise during the transition of customers from one of the merging parties to the other, the history of past acquisitions has been that such windows of opportunity last less than one year and that customer retention by the merging parties has been very high. Under these conditions, the incentive of the remaining firms to compete vigorously could be diminished.</p>
  
<p>Royal Bank and Bank of Montreal, individually or jointly, clearly have the ability to compete. As with <span class="NoWrap">the Bank of Nova Scotia</span>, a key question is whether or not they would have the same incentive to compete, given the reduction in the number of major competitors resulting from one or both mergers.</p>
  
<p>The Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank and <span class="NoWrap">Bank of Montreal</span>, as existing banks with national coverage, do not face the same barriers to expansion in individual markets as would new entrants. The effectiveness of such expansion, however, is constrained by customer switching costs and the expectation that branch profitability may take up to <span class="NoWrap">seven years</span>. Furthermore, as these banks continue to rationalize their branch networks, it is unlikely that they would choose to enter or expand in mature markets with low growth prospects.</p>
  
<p>It would be difficult for <span class="NoWrap">Canada Trust</span> and the <span class="NoWrap">National Bank</span> to replicate the competition removed by the merger where they do not now compete. <span class="NoWrap">National Bank</span>, for example, tried to expand significantly into <span class="NoWrap">southwestern Ontario</span> in the <span class="NoWrap">late 1980s</span> and subsequently withdrew from many locations. As well, <span class="NoWrap">Canada Trust</span> has focussed its efforts on <span class="NoWrap">faster-growing</span>, affluent urban and suburban markets and has shown little interest in expanding into many mature markets where the major banks are entrenched.</p>
  
<p>Most credit unions have a limited capacity to take on a large number of additional customers from the merging parties. In addition to capacity constraints faced by some community credit unions, there are a significant number of <span class="NoWrap">closed-bond</span> credit unions, whose members are limited to the same employer, industry, ethnic group or parish.</p>
  
<p>The Banks have pointed to <span class="NoWrap">ING Direct <abbr title="ING Direct">(ING)</abbr></span> as the type of competitive entrant now emerging. <abbr title="ING Direct">ING</abbr> offers a <span class="NoWrap">non-chequing</span> investment savings account from one office in Toronto. The account can be offered only if the consumer has a chequing account elsewhere. This product has no service fees, no minimum balance requirement and is fully insured by the <span class="NoWrap">Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation <abbr title="Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation">(CDIC)</abbr></span>. <abbr title="ING Direct">ING</abbr> pays a higher rate of interest than the major banks. According to <abbr title="ING Direct">ING</abbr> advertising, the average rate of interest paid over the past year is more than <span class="NoWrap">10 times</span> that offered by the major banks on a <span class="NoWrap">deposit of $4,500</span>. Despite this price differential, <abbr title="ING 
Direct">ING</abbr> has attracted less than <span class="NoWrap">0.2% of total</span> consumer deposits in the <span class="NoWrap">past 15 months</span> in Canada. It is too early to say how successful this experiment will be. It is also interesting to note that <abbr title="ING Direct">ING</abbr> will be supplementing its branchless service by establishing a physical presence through <abbr title="Automated Banking Machines">ABMs</abbr> in <span class="NoWrap">Canadian Tire stores</span>.</p>
  
<p>Another method of entry that has gained prominence in other countries is the use of kiosks in retail locations such as grocery or department stores. Two recent examples in Canada are the entry of <abbr title="President&#39;s Choice"><span class="NoWrap">PC Financial</span></abbr>, offered by Loblaws and supplied by <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr>, and the alliance between <span class="NoWrap">Toronto-Dominion</span> and <span class="NoWrap">Wal-Mart</span>. <abbr title="President&#39;s Choice"><span class="NoWrap">PC Financial</span></abbr> offers a <span class="NoWrap">no-fee chequing account</span> as well as personal loans and mortgages at lower rates than the major banks' posted rates, and is competitive with discretionary rates offered by the major banks. While this could be viewed as a new service, it could also be viewed as a different delivery channel for <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> rather than an entirely new 
competitor. Such alliances may also reduce access to prime locations for potential entrants.</p>
  
<p>All of the domestic banks, <span class="NoWrap">Canada Trust</span>, and a number of credit unions offer business banking services for <abbr title="small and medium-sized business">SME</abbr> customers. Of the <span class="NoWrap">Schedule II banks</span>, only the <span class="NoWrap">Hongkong Bank</span> of Canada has a sufficient number of branches to have any competitive significance in this market.</p>
  
<p>The Banks point to <span class="NoWrap">Wells Fargo</span> as an emerging competitive presence. <span class="NoWrap">Wells Fargo</span> has begun a small business lending program in Canada, providing <span class="NoWrap">$50 million</span> in loans. It is too early to say whether or not the <span class="NoWrap">Wells Fargo</span> model will work well in Canada. With less than <span class="NoWrap">0.05% of</span> all <abbr title="small and medium-sized businesses">SME</abbr> lending in Canada, it is clear that it does not constitute a significant competitor today in <span class="NoWrap">the Canadian market</span>.</p>
  
<p>For <span class="NoWrap">mid-market</span> firms, most credit unions are not effective competitors, due to the sophistication of the services required and the larger loan size. However, <span class="NoWrap">Schedule II banks</span> are able to compete in some urban areas.</p>

 <h5>Interdependent Behaviour</h5> 
  
<p>The Bureau has examined the proposed transaction to determine the potential for a substantial lessening of competition through the exercise of interdependent behaviour at both local and national levels. This lessening can result from either explicit agreements or from implicit recognition among firms that, in the new <span class="NoWrap">post-merger</span> environment, reduced competitive vigour would be more profitable for all.</p>
  
<p>A small number of sellers in any one market increases the risk of interdependent behaviour, and the Bureau has determined that the proposed merger significantly increases concentration in an already concentrated industry. If both proposed mergers proceed, the number of major banks will decline <span class="NoWrap">from five to three</span>, and concentration will be even higher. A high level of concentration in the relevant market is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for determining whether or not interdependent behaviour is likely to substantially lessen or prevent competition.</p>
  
<p>Other factors that facilitate interdependent behaviour are high barriers to entry, the homogeneity of products, the predictability of demand and costs, the stability of market shares, good information about pricing and customers, and the degree of industry cooperation (<abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr> in associations, joint ventures, alliances, networks and loan syndicates). To a large degree, these factors appear to be present in this industry.</p>
  
<p>It is important to note that <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> does not believe that collusion in banking is likely, given the repercussions such conduct would have if detected. However, in view of the expert advice received by <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> on this issue, there is concern that the proposed merger will increase the risk for reduced competitive vigour among the remaining major banks. This risk is compounded should the other proposed merger also proceed.</p>

 <h4>Identifying the Problematic Markets</h4> 
  
<p>To identify those markets in which a substantial lessening of competition would likely occur, <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> employed the principles explained below.</p>
  
<ul class="space">  
<li>Where the combined share of <span class="NoWrap">the Banks</span> in either personal or business transaction accounts is <span class="NoWrap">45% or greater,</span> it is the Bureau's conclusion that the proposed transaction will result in a substantial lessening of competition and would require a remedy. Transaction account data was chosen because it is the core of the banking relationship for personal and business customers.</li>  
<li>Those markets where the combined share in either personal or business transaction accounts is <span class="NoWrap">between 35% and 45%,</span> or the combined share of any of the other relevant products <span class="NoWrap">exceeds 35%,</span> are problematic. These markets require more review to determine if there are mitigating factors that would cause us to change this conclusion on the basis of new evidence obtained from <span class="NoWrap">the Banks</span> and third parties. It should be noted that our concern is heightened by the fact that, in many of these markets, the combined share of <span class="NoWrap">the Banks</span> in products other than transaction accounts <span class="NoWrap">exceeds 45%,</span> some by a considerable margin.</li>  
<li>The likelihood of concluding that the transaction would result in a substantial lessening of competition for markets in the problematic category is increased if the transaction proposed by the <span class="NoWrap">Royal Bank</span> and <span class="NoWrap">Bank of Montreal</span> proceeds.</li>  
<li>We have concluded that the merger will not result in a substantial lessening of competition where the combined market share of <span class="NoWrap">the Banks</span> is <span class="NoWrap">below 35%</span> in any relevant product.</li>
</ul>
  
<p><a href="http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01651.html" class="ui-link">Appendix B</a> provides details on this division of markets. <a href="http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01652.html" class="ui-link">Appendix C</a> identifies the markets that fall into each category. <a href="http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01653.html" class="ui-link">Appendix D</a> describes the rural markets identified by the Bureau.</p>
    
<p><em>These appendices set out the urban and rural markets which we have examined as part of our competition review. It is up to the Banks to propose how to address the conclusions set out in this letter. No inference is made and none should be drawn about the future of any branch located in any market listed <span class="NoWrap">in the attached appendices</span>.</em></p>

 <h4>Conclusions</h4> 
    
<p>For individuals, branch banking services consist of <span class="NoWrap">personal transaction accounts</span>, <span class="NoWrap">personal loans/lines</span> of credit and residential mortgages.</p>
    
<p>For businesses, in particular <abbr title="small and medium sized buisnesses">SMEs</abbr>, these services consist of business transaction accounts and related services, and operating loans.</p>
    
<p>(i) The proposed merger:</p>
    
<ul class="space">    

<li>will result in a substantial lessening of competition in <span class="NoWrap">36 of the 179 local markets</span> in which these banks compete;</li>    
<li>may result in a substantial lessening of competition in another <span class="NoWrap">53 local markets;</span> these markets are problematic and require further detailed review before we can confirm if a substantial lessening of competition will result;</li>     
<li>will not result in a substantial lessening of competition in the remaining <span class="NoWrap">90 local markets</span>.</li> 
</ul>
    
<p>(ii) The proposed merger:</p>

<ul class="space">
<li>will result in a substantial lessening of competition in <span class="NoWrap">Prince Edward Island</span>, Yukon and the <span class="NoWrap">Northwest Territories</span> for <span class="NoWrap">mid-market</span> businesses with operating loans between <span class="NoWrap">$1 million</span> and <span class="NoWrap">$5 million</span>.</li>
</ul>

 <h3>B. Credit Cards</h3>      
<h4>Product Markets</h4>         
      
<p>Within this category, we defined the following relevant product markets:</p>

<ul class="space">      
<li>General purpose credit card issuing to businesses</li>      
<li>General purpose credit card network services</li>        
<li>General purpose credit card issu
ing to individuals</li>        
<li>Visa merchant acquiring</li>        
<li>MasterCard merchant acquiring</li>        
<li>Primary merchant acquiring</li>
</ul>
      
<p>The Bureau concluded that no further review was required for general purpose credit card issuing to businesses <span class="NoWrap">(including corporate cards</span> and <span class="NoWrap">purchasing cards</span>), because the remaining competition was effective and provided businesses with adequate competitive alternatives or because the applicable thresholds were not crossed. For the purposes of this analysis, general purpose credit cards include charge cards such as <span class="NoWrap">Diners Club/enRoute</span> or <span class="NoWrap">American Express</span>. In addition, the proposed transaction does not have an impact on the MasterCard acquiring market since neither <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> nor <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> are members of MasterCard. A detailed review was required for the remaining product markets.</p>

 <h6>General Purpose Credit Card Network Services</h6> 
      
<p>A general purpose credit card network is the system that enables cardholders to have their cards widely accepted for the purchase of goods and services. Competition among networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, is known as <span class="NoWrap">inter-system competition</span>. Networks compete with each other by promoting brand awareness and by improving their systems, with the objective of being the preferred method of payment for goods and services.</p>
      
<p>Competition within a network also occurs among its members. This is known as <span class="NoWrap">intra-brand competition</span>. This type of competition is influenced by the number and type of network members, and by the rules and regulations of the network.</p>

 <h4>Geographic Market</h4> 
      
<p>The geographic market is national.</p>

 <h4>Market Shares and Concentration Levels</h4> 
      
<p>In Canada, Visa is the largest network in terms of total dollar volume of purchases made with general purpose credit and charge cards, followed by MasterCard, <span class="NoWrap">American Express</span> and <span class="NoWrap">Diners Club/enRoute</span>. The market shares for the networks will not likely change <span class="NoWrap">post-merger</span> since both <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> are Visa members.</p>

 
<h4>Competitive Criteria</h4>      
<h5>Barriers to Entry</h5>
 
      
<p>The barriers to new entry into the network market are very high, involving significant investment in establishing brand recognition among consumers and merchants, as well as in developing systems infrastructure.</p>

 <h5>Removal of a Vigorous and Effective Competitor</h5> 
      
<p>The proposed merger of <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> will not have an impact on the effectiveness of Visa as a network. However, <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce/Toronto-Dominion Bank"><span class="NoWrap">CIBC/TD</span></abbr> would be the dominant player within the Visa association. Should both mergers proceed, the position of <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce/Toronto-Dominion Bank"><span class="NoWrap">CIBC/TD</span></abbr> within <span class="NoWrap">Visa Canada</span> is likely to increase significantly, raising questions about corporate governance and the impact this governance could have on competition among Visa members, that is, on <span class="NoWrap">intra-brand competition</span>.</p>

 <h4>Conclusion</h4> 
      
<p>The proposed merger:</p>

<ul class="space">      
<li>will not result in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for general purposecredit card network services.</li>
</ul>

 <h6>General Purpose Credit Card Issuing to Individuals</h6> 
      
<p>While individual consumers use different methods for paying for goods and services, credit cards offer certain unique features that distinguish them from other means of payment. In particular, credit cards offer consumers a convenient form of credit: firstly, in the form of <span class="NoWrap">interest-free credit</span>, if the entire balance is paid off within a specified period of time; or alternatively, the ability to carry a balance, if the entire balance is not paid off. Credit cards also provide a number of other features, including widespread merchant acceptance and the ability to make remote purchases.</p>
      
<p>Charge cards offered by <span class="NoWrap">American Express</span> and <span class="NoWrap">Diners Club/enRoute</span> offer a number of the same features, except the ability to defer payment for purchases on a <span class="NoWrap">pre-approved</span> credit limit. Nor are they as widely accepted by merchants as Visa and MasterCard. However, due to the similarity of credit cards and charge cards, with the advice of experts retained by the Bureau, the Bureau has defined the issuing of Visa, MasterCard, <span class="NoWrap">American Express</span> and <span class="NoWrap">Diners Club/enRoute</span> cards as a relevant product market.</p>

 <h4>Geographic Market</h4> 
      
<p>While the branch network has historically been an important channel in the issuance of credit cards, the market appears to be changing. Since credit cards are effectively sold to consumers by mail, we have concluded that the geographic market is national.</p>

 <h4>Market Shares and Concentration Levels</h4> 
      
<p>The merging parties will have slightly <span class="NoWrap">greater than 35%</span> of the issuing market based on <span class="NoWrap">gross dollar volume</span> of transactions. If both mergers proceed, the concentration ratio for the top four firms will exceed the <span class="NoWrap">65% threshold</span>.</p>

 <h4>Competitive Criteria</h4>      
<h5>Barriers to Entry</h5> 
      
<p>Barriers to entry for the issuance of general purpose credit cards outside of the established Visa and MasterCard brands are very high, due to the time and difficulty in building widespread consumer and merchant acceptance. However, barriers to entry are not as significant within the established Visa and MasterCard brands.</p>
      
<p>Recent entry has occurred in the past <span class="NoWrap">five years</span>. New MasterCard issuers include <span class="NoWrap">Canadian Tire Acceptance Ltd.</span>, <span class="NoWrap">MBNA Canada Bank (<abbr title="MBNA Canada Bank">MBNA</abbr>)</span>, <span class="NoWrap">Capital One</span>, <span class="NoWrap">Trans Canada Credit</span> and <span class="NoWrap">ING Canada Bank</span>. <span class="NoWrap">Bank One</span> has recently become a member of <span class="NoWrap">Visa Canada</span> and is now issuing cards.</p>

 <h5>Effective Competition Remaining</h5> 
      
<p>There would appear to be effective competition remaining in the market. In the past few years, competition has increased with the expansion of MasterCard membership and the entry of <abbr title="United States"><span class="NoWrap">U.S. firms</span></abbr> that specialize in credit card issuing, namely <abbr title="MBNA Canada Bank">MBNA</abbr>, <span class="NoWrap">Capital One</span> and most recently <span class="NoWrap">Bank One</span>. While <abbr title="MBNA Canada Bank">MBNA</abbr> and <span class="NoWrap">Capital One</span> currently hold a small share of the market, they offer competitive products that have caused the other card issuers to respond.</p>

 <h4>Conclusion</h4> 
      
<p>The proposed merger:</p>
      
<ul class="space">
      
<li> will not result in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for the issuing of general purpose credit cards to individuals.</li>
</ul>

 <h5>Visa Merchant Acquiring</h5> 
      
<p>In order to accept credit cards as a method of payment, merchants must contract with an acquirer for services to process and guarantee payment of credit card transactions. Visa or MasterCard acquiring members are responsible for setting the fees charged for this service <span class="NoWrap">(the merchant discount rate)</span>, for guaranteeing payment to the merchant and for settling with other issuers who are members of either the Visa or MasterCard associations, respectively.</p>
      
<p>Visa acquirers compete with each other for the right to acquire and settle Visa transactions, while MasterCard acquirers compete with each other to acquire and settle MasterCard transactions. Each Visa acquirer sets the merchant discount rate for its Visa transactions, and each MasterCard acquirer sets the merchant discount rate for its MasterCard transactions.</p>
      
<p>Most merchants need to be able to accept both Visa and MasterCard. Under the existing rules and policies of Visa and MasterCard, members may not acquire transactions of a competing card. Consequently, Visa merchant acquiring and MasterCard merchant acquiring constitute separate markets.</p>
      
<p>Both <abbr title="Canadiam Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronot-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> are Visa merchant acquiring members and therefore there is overlap in their businesses in the Visa merchant acquiring market.</p>

 <h6>Primary Merchant Acquiring</h6> 
      
<p>Primary acquiring can be defined as a package of services sold to merchants, which includes both the provision of terminal services and the provision of either Visa or MasterCard acquiring services.</p>
      
<p>Terminal services include the provision of the terminal at the merchant's location. It also includes data transmission and software to route transactions to the appropriate network, such as MasterCard, Visa or <span class="NoWrap">Interac debit</span>. The majority of terminals now being deployed in Canada are <span class="NoWrap">multi-functional</span> and allow merchants to accept all types of credit cards as well as debit cards.</p>
      
<p>For small and <span class="NoWrap">medium-sized merchants</span>, terminal services and acquiring services for either Visa or MasterCard are usually purchased as a package from the same financial institution, although the Bureau recognizes that, for large merchants, the services may be purchased separately.</p>
      
<p>Typically, merchants have at least two acquirer relationships, but only one terminal provider. <span class="NoWrap">The Banks</span> claim that new arrangements are being developed for the convenience of merchants. An example is the <span class="NoWrap">"Merchant's Edge"</span> program between <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <span class="NoWrap">Canada Trust</span>, where <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> is the primary acquirer furnishing the terminal and, at the merchant's option, <span class="NoWrap">Canada Trust</span> is the MasterCard acquirer setting the MasterCard merchant discount rate. This reduces the need for merchants to establish a second acquiring relationship themselves. However, <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> understands that for primary acquirers to establish a partnership of this nature, they need to be assured that their partner will not target their primary acquiring relationships. 
Such assurance will only arise if the partner has limited or no presence in the primary acquiring market.</p>

 <h4>Geographic Market</h4>      
<h6>Visa Merchant Acquiring</h6> 
      
<p>The same considerations apply with respect to this market as those that apply to the primary merchant acquiring business.</p>

 <h5>Primary Merchant Acquiring</h5> 
      
<p>At present, many financial institutions service their merchant acquiring customers through their branches. Increasingly though, financial institutions are relying on centralized service centres and specialized teams of sales representatives to service this market, which may be expected to expand the geographic market to a national level. Consequently, the Bureau has concluded that this is a market in transition to the national level.</p>

 <h4>Market Shares and Concentration Levels</h4>      
<h6>Visa Merchant Acquiring</h6> 
      
<p>With respect to the Visa merchant acquiring market, the combined market share for <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> exceeds the <span class="NoWrap">35% threshold</span> on a national basis.</p>

 <h6>Primary Merchant Acquiring</h6> 
      
<p>The four largest primary merchant acquirers at the national level are <span class="NoWrap">Royal Bank</span>, <span class="NoWrap">Bank of Montreal</span>, <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr>. The combined market share for <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> primary merchant acquiring is within the range of <span class="NoWrap">30% to 40%</span> at the national level.</p>

 <h4>Competitive Criteria</h4>      
<h5>Barriers to Entry</h5>      
<h6>Visa Merchant Acquiring</h6> 
      
<p>Within the Visa association, financial institutions need to be <span class="NoWrap">deposit-taking</span> in order to be acquiring members of the <span class="NoWrap">Visa brand</span>. As such, the entry of <span class="NoWrap">third-party</span> processors from the <span class="NoWrap">United States</span> would not, under the present Visa rules, provide entry as a Visa acquirer, because they are not <span class="NoWrap">deposit-taking institutions</span> in Canada. Furthermore, in terms of a MasterCard primary acquirer seeking to establish a <span class="NoWrap">"Merchant's Edge"</span> type of arrangement with a Visa merchant acquirer, as noted above, the choice would likely be limited to those institutions who will not target their primary acquiring relationships. In terms of new entrants into the Visa merchant acquiring markets, not only would they need to be <span class="NoWrap">deposit-taking institutions</span>, but the time frame for building the gateway systems 
required in light of other information technology priorities, such as <span class="NoWrap">year 2000 problems</span>, would mean that effective entry is unlikely to occur within the Bureau's <span class="NoWrap">two-year</span> time frame.</p>

 <h6>Primary Merchant Acquiring</h6> 
      
<p>There are significant barriers to entry, particularly in providing primary acquiring services to <abbr title="small and medium-sized business"><span class="NoWrap">SME merchants</span></abbr>.</p>
      
<p>The Banks have a strong advantage in an established <span class="NoWrap">brand name</span> and the use of an extensive national branch network to facilitate referrals <span class="NoWrap">and/or</span> service to clients. The majority of <abbr title="small and medium-sized business"><span class="NoWrap">SME merchants</span></abbr> still prefer to purchase their primary merchant acquiring services from their main financial institution. This places <span class="NoWrap">non-banks</span> at a disadvantage and may deter entry into this market.</p>
      
<p>The Banks contend that <span class="NoWrap">non-banks</span>, particularly <span class="NoWrap">third-party</span> processors that are able to leverage scale from their<span class="NoWrap"> <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> operations</span>, are poised to enter the Canadian marketplace as primary acquirers. Since these firms are not members of the associations in Canada, they do not by themselves have direct acc
ess to the credit card networks. As a result, they would need to ally themselves with an existing Visa or MasterCard acquiring member in order to provide the full primary acquiring package. Although there is evidence that these processors are operating in Canada as providers of terminal services, in partnership with some Visa and MasterCard acquirers, they appear to be targeting large merchants who are able to purchase their terminal services separately. They are not generally servicing <abbr title="small and medium-sized business"><span class="NoWrap">SME 
merchants</span></abbr>.</p>
      
<p>The Bureau also understands that economies of scale in transaction processing may present a barrier for smaller Canadian banks entering or seeking to expand their primary merchant acquiring business, although the precise nature of these economies of scale has not been determined. While economies of scale may present difficulties for smaller Canadian institutions, they would not be a significant barrier for <abbr title="United States"><span class="NoWrap">U.S. acquirers</span></abbr> entering the Canadian market to the extent that they have leverage from their existing <abbr title="United States"><span class="NoWrap">U.S. transaction</span></abbr> volumes.</p>
      
<p>The Bureau recognizes that entry by a large <span class="NoWrap">third-party</span> processor allied with an existing Visa or MasterCard member could significantly change the competitive dynamic of this market. However, it does not appear likely that this will occur within the <span class="NoWrap">two-year time frame</span> of our analysis.</p>

 <h5>Removal of an Effective Competitor</h5> 
      
<p>The proposed merger will result in the loss of competitive rivalry between <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr>, and will remove an important competitor, particularly for <abbr title="small and medium-sized business">SME</abbr> merchants, in both the primary merchant acquiring market and the Visa merchant acquiring market. <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> are among the top four primary merchant acquirers in Canada and the top three Visa merchant acquirers. They have been effective competitors, and customers have benefited from the competition between them.</p>

 <h5>Effective Competition Remaining</h5>      
<h6>Visa Merchant Acquiring</h6> 
      
<p>Excluding <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr>, there are five Visa member banks that offer Visa merchant acquiring services. <span class="NoWrap">Post-merger</span>, the combined <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce/Toronto-Dominion Bank"></abbr><span class="NoWrap">CIBC/TD</span> entity will have the largest share of the Visa merchant acquiring market and only two other Visa merchant acquirers have a national presence. Should both mergers proceed, with <span class="NoWrap">Royal Bank</span> converting to MasterCard, that number would be reduced to one.</p>
      
<p>With both mergers proceeding, where a MasterCard primary merchant acquirer is looking to partner with a <span class="NoWrap">Visa merchant acquirer</span> for a <span class="NoWrap">"Merchant's Edge"</span> type of arrangement, choices would be limited. At this stage, it is unclear how well positioned smaller Visa merchant acquirers are to take on increased transaction volume and risk control systems associated with operating a national Visa merchant acquiring business.</p>

 <h6>Primary Merchant Acquiring</h6> 
      
<p>The Royal Bank, <span class="NoWrap">Bank of Montreal</span> and <span class="NoWrap">Bank of Nova Scotia</span> have been effective competitors with <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> in the primary acquiring market for <abbr title="small and medium-sized business"><span class="NoWrap">SME merchants</span></abbr>. <span class="NoWrap">The National Bank</span> and <span class="NoWrap">Caisses Desjardins</span> represent significant competition in Quebec.</p>
      
<p>Despite the number of remaining competitors in this market, the Banks' claims that economies of scale are important in this market suggest that smaller competitors are at a cost disadvantage. This may limit their effectiveness post-merger.</p>
      
<p>It is likely that if both proposed mergers were completed, the primary merchant acquiring market would be dominated by the two merged firms in most areas in Canada outside of Quebec.</p>

 <h4>Conclusions</h4> 
      
<p>(i) The proposed merger:</p>
      
<ul class="space">      
<li>will result in a substantial lessening of competition in the Visa merchant acquiring market (the business of providing settlement of <em>Visa</em> credit card transactions to merchants).</li>
</ul>
      
<p>(ii) The proposed merger:</p>
      
<ul class="space">      
<li>may result, at the national level, in a substantial lessening of competition for primary merchant acquiring (the business of providing both terminals and settlement of credit card transactions to merchants) for <abbr title="small and medium-sized business"><span class="NoWrap">SME merchants</span></abbr>. <em>Primary</em> merchant acquiring is problematic and requires further detailed review at the local or regional level before we can confirm if a substantial lessening of competition will result.</li>

</ul>

 <h3>C. Securities</h3>      
<h4>Product Markets</h4> 
      
<p>Within this category of services we defined the following product markets:</p>
      
<ul class="space">      
<li>Equity underwriting</li>
<li>Debt underwriting</li>
<li>Institutional equity trading</li>
<li>Institutional debt trading</li>
<li>Mergers and acquisitions advice</li>
<li><span class="NoWrap">Full-service brokerage</span> <span class="NoWrap">(execution of trades with advice)</span></li> 
<li>Discount brokerage <span class="NoWrap">(execution of trades without advice)</span></li>
</ul>
        
<p>We have concluded that the proposed merger does not raise competition concerns in the equity underwriting, debt underwriting, institutional equity trading, institutional debt trading, or mergers and acquisitions advice markets. These conclusions were reached because there are sufficient competitive alternatives remaining <span class="NoWrap">post-merger</span> or applicable thresholds were not exceeded. However, a detailed review was required for the remaining product markets.</p>

 <h6>Full-service Brokerage</h6> 
      
<p>Full-service brokers are distinct from discount brokers because they provide advice.</p>
      
<p>Discount brokers cater to essentially "<span class="NoWrap">do-it-yourself</span>" customers who do their own research or buy <span class="NoWrap">third-party</span> research. They do not receive advice tailored to their individual needs. Consequently, the cost of <span class="NoWrap">full-service</span> brokerage services is significantly different from the cost of discount brokerage. For example, the banks have indicated that a typical <span class="NoWrap">$450 trade</span> with a <span class="NoWrap">full-service</span> broker would <span class="NoWrap">cost $85</span> through a discount brokerage and <span class="NoWrap">$30 through</span> an electronic discount broker.</p>
      
<p>These significant price differentials, combined with evidence that discount pricing does not discipline <span class="NoWrap">full-service pricing</span>, indicate that <span class="NoWrap">full-service</span> and discount brokerage services should be treated separately.</p>

 <h4>Geographic Market</h4> 
      
<p>The evidence indicates that the <span class="NoWrap">full-service</span> brokerage business is local in scope. Most clients want local investment advice and a conveniently located office, close to where they live or work. This is demonstrated by the fact that both <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank"><span class="NoWrap">TD Evergreen</span></abbr>, owned by <span class="NoWrap">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span>, and <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce"><span class="NoWrap">CIBC/Wood Gundy</span></abbr> have set up branch offices throughout Canada.</p>

 <h4>Market Shares and Concentration Levels</h4> 
      
<p>In order to determine the market position of the parties, the Bureau gathered <span class="NoWrap">first-hand</span> information on assets under administration from <span class="NoWrap">full-service</span> brokers in each local market. This measure is used in the industry to measure market shares. The alternative measure proposed recently, equity trading commissions, is readily available only on a provincial basis. It does not provide information on income derived from debt products or other sources. Accordingly, the Bureau has used the local market share data currently available.</p>
      
<p>In three of the <span class="NoWrap">22 local markets</span> in which the two firms compete, the merging parties have a combined market share of <span class="NoWrap">35% or greater</span>.</p>

 
<h4>Competitive Criteria</h4>      
<h5>Barriers to Entry</h5>
 
      
<p>Barriers to entry and expansion into the <span class="NoWrap">full-service</span> brokerage market are high. Building a base of trained investment advisers is both costly and <span class="NoWrap">time-consuming</span>. Based on estimates from <span class="NoWrap">third parties</span>, it costs <span class="NoWrap">between $300 000 and $800 000</span> to develop a successful investment adviser.</p>
      
<p>Integrated firms, such as <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce"><span class="NoWrap">CIBC Wood Gundy</span></abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank"><span class="NoWrap">TD Securities Inc./<abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> Evergreen</span></abbr>, that offer <span class="NoWrap">full-service</span> brokerage as well as equity underwriting and institutional trading, have a number of advantages over smaller unintegrated firms.</p>
      
<p>Reliable research is a key component of the advice given by the investment adviser. Research is also a necessary input into underwriting services and institutional trading. Integrated firms can more easily support the costs of research across three business lines – individual client services, underwriting services and institutional trading – than across just one line. Underwriting services also provide a competitive advantage in that clients of the integrated firm will have greater access to new issues of securities than clients of unintegrated firms. <span class="NoWrap">Bank-owned dealers</span> have the additional advantage of obtaining a significant proportion of their business from referrals of bank branch customers.</p>
      
<p>Even with these advantages, growth in the <span class="NoWrap">full-service business</span> has largely been accomplished by acquisitions, rather than internal growth. The recent acquisition of <span class="NoWrap">Midland Walwyn</span> by <span class="NoWrap">Merrill Lynch</span> is a case in point.</p>

 <h5>Removal of a Vigorous and Effective Competitor</h5> 
      
<p>The proposed merger removes an effective but relatively small competitor from most of the markets where the firms currently compete.</p>

 <h5>Effective Competition Remaining</h5> 
      
<p><span class="NoWrap">Nesbitt Burns</span>, <abbr title="Royal Bank of Canada "><span class="NoWrap">RBC Dominion Securities</span></abbr>, <span class="NoWrap">Merrill Lynch</span> and <span class="NoWrap">Scotia McLeod</span> provide effective competition in many local markets across Canada. <span class="NoWrap">Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion</span>, with approximately <span class="NoWrap">1,300 investment advisers</span>, is also an effective competitor, particularly in the province of Quebec. In a number of local markets, <span class="NoWrap">full-service firms</span> compete with smaller <span class="NoWrap">full-service brokerages</span>.</p>

 <h4>Conclusions</h4> 
      
<p>The proposed merger:</p>
     
<ul class="space">     
<li>will result in a substantial lessening of competition in one market of the <span class="NoWrap">22 local markets</span> in which <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce"><span class="NoWrap">CIBC Wood Gundy</span></abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank"><span class="NoWrap">TD Evergreen</span></abbr> compete in <span class="NoWrap">full-service brokerage</span>;</li>
<li>may result in a substantial lessening of competition in <span class="NoWrap">two markets</span>; these markets are problematic and require further detailed review before we can confirm if a substantial lessening of competition will result;</li>
<li>will not result in a substantial lessening of competition in <span class="NoWrap">19 markets</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These conclusions are based in part on the market share levels as measured by assets under administration in local markets. The Bureau would be prepared to review these conclusions, if information having a material impact becomes available at the local level which would indicate that the market shares, as calculated, significantly overstate the market position of the <span class="NoWrap">Bank-owned firms</span>.</p>
  
<p><a href="http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01655.html" class="ui-link">Appendix E</a> identifies the markets that fall into each category.</p>

 <h6>Discount Brokerage (Execution of Trades without Advice)</h6> 
  
<p>As noted above, the Bureau has concluded that the execution of securities trades without advice is a separate product market. While <span class="NoWrap">full-service</span> brokers will sometimes lower price for a trade where no advice is provided, in most cases there is a wide margin between prices charged by <span class="NoWrap">full-service</span> brokers and discount brokers. The discount brokerage service offered by <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> is called <span class="NoWrap">Greenline Investor Services (<abbr title="Greenline Investor Services">Greenline</abbr>)</span>, while the service offered by <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> is known as <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce"><span class="NoWrap">CIBC Investor's Edge</span></abbr>.</p>

 <h4>Geographic Market</h4> 
  
<p>The discount brokerage market is national in scope. Trades are made via <span class="NoWrap">toll-free numbers</span> and <span class="NoWrap">on-line</span> through personal computers. While local physical presence assists in market penetration, it is not necessary to compete in this market. Discount brokers have national pricing.</p>

 <h4>Market Share and Concentration Levels</h4> 
  
<p>In order to determine the market position of <span class="NoWrap">the Banks</span>, <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> has used assets under administration. This measure is used in the industry to measure market shares.</p>
  
<p>Based on this measure, a combined Greenline and <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr><span class="NoWrap">Investor's Edge operation</span> would represent over <span class="NoWrap">45% of the discount</span> brokerage market in Canada.</p>

 <h4>Competitive Criteria</h4>  
<h5>Barriers to Entry</h5> 
  
<p>The barriers to entry appear to be moderate, as evidenced by the large number of 
recent entrants into this market. <span class="NoWrap">Since 1990</span>, there have been <span class="NoWrap">nine new entrants</span>, including the discount brokerage operations of the <span class="NoWrap">Canada Trust</span>, <span class="NoWrap">Royal Bank</span>, <span class="NoWrap">Bank of Montreal</span>, <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr>, <span class="NoWrap">Bank of Nova Scotia</span>, <span class="NoWrap">Caisses Desjardins</span>, <span class="NoWrap">National Bank</span> and <span class="NoWrap">Hongkong Bank</span> of Canada. In addition to the <span class="NoWrap">bank-owned</span> discount brokers, <span class="NoWrap">Versus Brokerage</span> is currently offering a discount service over the Internet known as <abbr title="Versus Brokerage electronic discount service">E*Trade</abbr>.</p>
  
<p>The main barriers appear to be brand recognition and achieving sufficient scale to render the investments in call centres and technology profitable. All of the major banks have brand recognition and an ability to attract discount brokerage customers from their large base of existing bank customers.</p>
  
<p>The discount brokerage market has experienced significant growth in the <span class="NoWrap">past few years</span> as investors seek lower fees for the purchase and sale of securities and mutual funds. This high level of growth has attracted new entrants.</p>

 <h5>Removal of an Effective and Vigorous Competitor</h5> 
  
<p>Documentary evidence collected by the Bureau indicates that other competitors view <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce"><span class="NoWrap">CIBC Investor's Edge</span></abbr> as a price and technology follower in the market and that it has not been very successful in capturing <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce"><span class="NoWrap">non-CIBC</span></abbr> customers. This evidence suggests that the <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> discount brokerage operation is not a particularly vigorous competitor.</p>

 <h5>Effective Competition Remaining</h5> 
  
<p>As a result of new entrants into the discount brokerage business, the market share of the current leader, Greenline, has been steadily declining over the past few years.</p>
  
<p>Documentary evidence indicates that the <span class="NoWrap">Bank of Montreal's Investorline service</span> is viewed as being very aggressive on pricing, with a product line second only to <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion&#39;s Greenline Investor Services">Greenline</abbr>. <abbr title="Royal Bank of Canada"><span class="NoWrap">RBC Action Direct</span></abbr> offers similar products and pricing. The other firms have small market shares, but are growing. The entry of <abbr title="Versus Brokerage electronic discount service">E*Trade</abbr>, with its <span class="NoWrap">$27 flat fee</span> for trades, has forced the other discounters, including <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion&#39;s Greenline Investor Services">Greenline</abbr>, to respond with similar pricing for trading by computer.</p>

 <h4>Conclusion</h4> 
  
<p>The proposed merger:</p>

<ul class="space">  
<li>will not result in a substantial lessening of competition in the national market for discount brokerage services.</li>
</ul>

<p>This conclusion takes into account the moderate barriers to entry combined with the number of new competitors, which together have steadily eroded the dominant position of <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion&#39;s Greenline Investor Services">Greenline</abbr>.</p>

 <h2>Efficiency Claims</h2> 
  
<p>As the Guidelines state, the onus of demonstrating efficiencies rests with <span class="NoWrap">the Banks</span>. The <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> claim that cost savings will result if they are permitted to merge. The Banks estimate that the merger will result in annual cost savings of at least <span class="NoWrap">10% of the non-interest expense</span> of the combined bank.</p>
  
<p>While it is difficult to quantify efficiencies <span class="NoWrap">pre-merger</span>, it seems reasonable that the proposed merger would produce cost savings. A variety of studies and <span class="NoWrap">consultants' reports</span> reviewed by the Bureau identify <span class="NoWrap">three general areas</span> in which a bank merger can be the source of cost savings.</p>
  
<p>Efficiency gains from a bank merger may arise through greater scale economies or rationalization in banking operations. This may be done by consolidating payment services, deposit inquiries and accounting, and <span class="NoWrap">loan-monitoring</span> operations. Further gains may be realized through the expansion of the range of banking products. Adding new products to existing lines of business can allow for economies of scope rather than providing products individually. By adopting each other's best practices, banks can realize further important efficiencies.</p>
  
<p>However, the same studies also indicate that these potential efficiencies may not be realized in all mergers.</p>
  
<p><abbr title="The United States">U.S.</abbr> research of mergers between large banks indicates that the cost savings expected by <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> are consistent with those realized only after successful integration. The studies show that successful integration is more likely to occur if merging banks have previously participated in a large merger. Both <abbr title="Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce">CIBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion Bank">TD</abbr> have had experience in smaller acquisitions. Yet neither has merged with an organization of comparable size. This adds to the difficulty of assessing the likelihood of the merger successfully generating the expected efficiencies.</p>
  
<p>Research also indicates that about <span class="NoWrap">one-half</span> of large bank mergers reduce costs, while <span class="NoWrap">one-half</span> realize no change in costs, or even incur increased costs. Thus, it is unclear the extent to which the claimed efficiencies will be realized.</p>
  
<p>When it is likely that the efficiencies would outweigh the <span class="NoWrap">anti-competitive</span> impact of a merger, the <cite>Competition Act</cite> provides an exception to allow the merger to proceed. As outlined in <span class="NoWrap">the Guidelines</span>, it has been <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau's policy</span> that, in <span class="NoWrap">non-bank cases</span> where there is a likelihood of a substantial lessening or prevention of competition, as there is in this case, and the parties to the merger are claiming efficiency gains, the case would be brought to the <span class="NoWrap">Competition Tribunal</span> for resolution.</p>
  
<p>However, in this case, efficiency gains arising from the merger, to a large extent, will be shaped by the public interest concerns to be expressed by the <span class="NoWrap">Minister of Finance</span>. Given these circumstances, <span class="NoWrap">the Banks</span> will not be able to accurately project the magnitude of the efficiencies until such time as they hear from the <span class="NoWrap">Minister of Finance</span>.</p>

<p>The Bureau stated in its Guidelines that in reviewing the proposed bank mergers it would consider the impact on the regulatory environment of recommendations made by the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force</span>. Enhancing competition in the financial services sector is a major focus of the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force</span> report, released on <span class="NoWrap">September 15, 1998</span>.</p>
  
<p>The Bureau welcomes the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force's</span> emphasis on increased competition and views its recommendations aimed at enhancing competition as a positive step.</p>
  
<p>Among the various measures proposed by the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force</span> to enhance competition, those relating to ownership structure, enhancing the capacity of the <span class="NoWrap">co-operative</span> sector, and access to the payments system have the potential for the greatest impact on the marketplace.</p>
  
<p>Overall, even if a decision to adopt all the <span class="NoWrap">pro-competitive</span> recommendations made by the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force</span> were made immediately, the decision would be unlikely to have a substantial impact on competition in the markets of concern within the <span class="NoWrap">two-year time frame</span> used in <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau's</span> merger analysis. Making the legislative changes needed to implement regulatory reforms will take some time and there would likely be some delay before market participants would respond.</p>
  
<p>Since the impact of the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force's</span> recommendations is more likely to be felt beyond <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau's</span> <span class="NoWrap">two-year time frame</span>, the proposed mergers were assessed in the context of the existing regulatory framework. As noted above, economic barriers affecting the state of competition in the relevant markets are significant. As a result, even if the regulatory environment envisioned by the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force</span> were implemented today, <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau's</span> assessment of the proposed mergers would likely reach the same conclusions.</p>
  
<p>The Task Force report also commented on the analytical framework used by <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> in reviewing mergers in the financial services sector. While supporting the approach outlined in <span class="NoWrap">the Guidelines</span>, the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force</span> suggests that <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> give particular attention to a number of factors relating to market definition and the impact of a bank merger within certain markets.</p>
  
<p>Specifically, the Task Force recommended that <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> pay particular attention to the following:</p>

<ul class="space">  
<li>the competition concerns of small and <span class="NoWrap">medium-sized business</span>,</li>
<li>users of personal financial services who may still be <span class="NoWrap">branch-dependent</span>, and</li>
<li>the new competitive choices that already exist in respect of certain product lines and that are also likely to emerge as a result of new distribution channels and the liberalization of public policy constraints.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>In assessing the proposed mergers, <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> considered each of these factors carefully. The impact of technology on the delivery of financial services, particularly the emergence of new distribution channels, is a prominent theme in the <span class="NoWrap">Task Force report</span>. We agree, and have highlighted how <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> considered technology in its assessment of the proposed mergers.</p>

 <h2>Potential Remedies</h2> 
  
<p>Following the process outlined in <span class="NoWrap">the Guidelines</span>, it is not practical to consider possible remedies until <span class="NoWrap">the Banks</span> have heard the public interest concerns of the <span class="NoWrap">Minister of Finance</span>. However, it is useful to highlight the process that has typically been followed by <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span>, the principles it sees as important in pursuing any remedies, and the types of remedies that have been applied to competition concerns in other cases.</p>
  
<p>After being informed of the competition concerns by <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span>, the onus then lies with <span class="NoWrap">the Banks</span> to determine whether or not they wish to proceed with the proposal, and if so, to identify and present remedies that remove these concerns. To be effective, a remedy must embody the following principles:</p>

<ul class="space">  
<li>The substantial lessening of competition must be removed in all affected markets.</li>
<li>It must permit sustained and effective competition so that consumers will continue to enjoy the benefits of competition.</li>
<li>It must be implemented on a timely basis. For instance, assets should be sold prior to the completion of the merger, or within a specified time thereafter. Failure to comply would result in assets being placed in the hands of a trustee for sale.</li>
<li>The necessity for ongoing regulatory oversight should be limited.</li>
<li>Implementation of the remedy must be enforceable and transparent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Traditionally, the above principles have been satisfied through remedies that focussed on structural rather than behavioural measures. Assuming the Banks decide that it is appropriate to proceed further, the most effective structural remedy is the divestiture of assets away from the merged company to others that will provide effective and sustainable competition. There is no formula for identifying in advance which assets may satisfy such conditions. Rather, to the extent that such a remedy is possible, it is <span class="NoWrap">case-specific</span> and dependent upon the nature and extent of the competition concerns identified.</p>
  
<p>With regard to remedies pursued in other countries, concerns similar to those identified in the current proposal about branch banking have been resolved through branch divestitures. Such remedies have generally been considered to be effective in the United States. However, whether or not such a remedy would be either practical or sufficient to address the concerns identified in this letter remains to be determined. The viability of such a remedy also depends on the financial strength of the purchaser and its ability to support branch banking operations.</p>
  
<p>The divestiture of brand names has often been a consideration in other mergers and may be highly appropriate for bank mergers. Acquiring a recognized brand may assist the purchaser in establishing a strong market presence more quickly.</p>
  
<p>It should also be noted that the market share threshold to which divestiture would be required may well depend on whether or not the proposed <span class="NoWrap">Royal Bank-Bank of Montreal</span> transaction proceeds. If it proceeds, a lower market share threshold may be required because of the increased concentration that would occur by both mergers occurring simultaneously.</p>
  
<p>Branch bank divestitures, which might have an impact on the primary merchant acquiring market and the Visa merchant acquiring market, would have to be examined from that perspective. In addition, the constitution of Visa would have to ensure that no single member could dominate <span class="NoWrap">Visa Canada</span>.</p>
  
<p>As the foregoing indicates, the proposed transaction raises serious competition issues. <span class="NoWrap">The Bureau</span> has given consideration to each of these issues and has attempted to explain the basis for its conclusions as fully as possible, while taking into account the importance of the proposed merger and respecting the confidentiality provisions in the <em><span class="NoWrap">Competition Act</span></em>.</p>
  
<p>As stated in <span class="NoWrap">the Guidelines</span>, if after receipt of this letter and taking into account any public interest concerns expressed by the <span class="NoWrap">Minister of Finance</span>, <span class="NoWrap">the Banks</span> decide it is appropriate to explore potential remedies with <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span>, we would be pleased to do so at your convenience.</p>
  
<p>Yours sincerely,<br>
Konrad von Finckenstein, Q.C.</p>

 <h2>Footnote</h2> 

<p id="footnote1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The <abbr title="small and medium-sized business"><span class="NoWrap">SME sector</span></abbr> encompasses a diverse range of businesses and services that defy easy measurement based on dollar sales or loans outstanding. However, to simplify the analysis, <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> has adopted the definition of <abbr title="small and medium-sized business"><span class="NoWrap">SME borrowers</span></abbr> used by the <span class="NoWrap">Conference Board</span>, that is, firms that borrow <span class="NoWrap">$1 million or less</span>. Within the <abbr title="small and medium-sized business"><span class="NoWrap">SME sector</span></abbr>, there are <span class="NoWrap">at least two distinct groups</span> based on the nature of security offered for the loan: individuals and small firms that rely on a personal covenant; and firms that secure the loan based on an assessment of the creditworthiness of the business itself. In 
attempting to 
capture these differences, <span class="NoWrap">the Bureau</span> looked at market share information for operating loans <span class="NoWrap">up to $200 000</span> and <span class="NoWrap">between $200 000 and $1 million</span>. <span class="NoWrap">(<a href="http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01601.html#footnote1b" class="ui-link">back to footnote reference 1</a>)</span></p>
