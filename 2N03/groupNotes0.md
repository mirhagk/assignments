Discussed what is problem.

Problem is about us?

Are we ready?

First question:

Have to figure things out and then teach it to each other?

What are you ready for? What's it about?

Problem based learning - learn to retain, work in groups, interesting blah blah


+ chance to find out thigns for ourselves
+ will retain more of our knowledge
+ Compare to case studies, cs we're given requirements
+ Learning based on solving problems, asking questions
+ dev crit thinking skills
+ research
+ coming up with answer on our own
+ prompting towards question, we figure out answer
+ analyzing different perspectives

What does it mean to be ready for this course?

+ last question might be rhetorical, or 2nd part (answer is pretty much have to be yes)
+ what skills do you need to be ready?
+ what do you know?
+ good attitude self discipline
+ willing to participate
	+ How much you engage in material
	+ How much you learn /\
+ Problem based learning can't be physics or math, hard science
+ Needs open endedness
+ Opinion based
+ as long as it's not sandboxed
