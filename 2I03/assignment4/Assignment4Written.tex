\section{Introduction}

RCImmix is an extension of modern reference counting, including many optimizations to decrease the problems with reference counting\footnote{Reference counting's inability to collect cycles is an example} and increase the performance to make it competitive to a tracing garbage collector\footnote{The reference counting engine in languages such as Objective-C and PHP are 40\% slower than modern tracing garbage collectors}.

\section{Reference Counting vs Tracing Garbage Collection}

There has been much debate in the past over which methods should be used, and each has a set of pros and cons. The next few sections cover the pros and cons of reference counting.

\subsection{Overview}

As with all reference counting, the user interacts with the garbage collector by calling 2 methods.
